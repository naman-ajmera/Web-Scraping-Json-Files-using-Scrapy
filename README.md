# Web Scraping Json Files using Scrapy
Scraping 'trumptwitterarchive.com'. This site shows all the tweets of Donald Trump. I scrape the site using the json files fro the website and store accordingly.
Rather than scraping the whole website for tweets I only look for the json files in the network section of chrome inspection tool.
TO RUN:- scrapy crawl tweet
